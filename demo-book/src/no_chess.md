# No Chess

Just to make sure we don't break things here's a markdown file with a bunch of
non-chess elements.

| Syntax | Description | Misc 1 | Misc 2 | 
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | ---- |
| Header | Title | **Hello** | | 
| Paragraph | Text | | _what?_ |

- [x] Check other markdown things
- [ ] Make it work
- [ ] Get better at chess. [^1]

[^1]: Longer time formats, not bullet you degenerate.
